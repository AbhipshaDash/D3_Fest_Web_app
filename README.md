# PM 2.5 Level Prediction Using Weather Data
This project involves predicting PM 2.5 levels using historical weather data through a machine learning model deployed on Streamlit. The model, processes inputs such as temperature, pressure, rainfall, wind direction, and wind speed to provide accurate predictions of PM 2.5 levels. Users can interact with the Streamlit application to input weather parameters and instantly receive predictions, aiding in real-time air quality monitoring and decision-making. This work secured third place in the D^3 Hackathon, demonstrating its effectiveness and innovation in environmental monitoring.
